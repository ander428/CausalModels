\usage{
stdm(
  data,
  f = NA,
  family = gaussian(),
  simple = pkg.env$simple,
  p.f = NA,
  p.simple = pkg.env$simple,
  p.family = binomial(),
  p.scores = NA,

  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data frame containing the variables in the model.
This should be the same data used in \code{\link[init_params]{init_params}}.}

\item{f}{(optional) an object of class "formula" that overrides the default parameter}

\item{family}{(optional) the family to be used in the general linear model.
By default, this is set to \code{\link[stats:gaussian]{gaussian}}.}

\item{simple}{(optional) a boolean indicator to build default formula with interactions.
If true, interactions will be excluded. If false, interactions will be included. By
default, simple is set to false.
NOTE: if this is changed, the coefficient for treatment may not accurately represent the average causal effect.}

\item{p.f}{(optional) an object of class "formula" that overrides the default formula for the denominator of the IP
weighting function.}

\item{p.simple}{(optional) a boolean indicator to build default formula with interactions for the propensity models.
If true, interactions will be excluded. If false, interactions will be included. By
default, simple is set to false.
NOTE: if this is changed, the coefficient for treatment may not accurately represent the average causal effect.}

\item{p.family}{(optional) the family to be used in the underlying propensity model.
By default, this is set to \code{\link[stats:gaussian]{binomial}}.}

\item{p.scores}{(optional) use calculated propensity scores for the weights. If using standardized weights,
the numerator will still be modeled.}

\item{SW}{(optional) a boolean indicator to indicate the use of standardized weights. By default, this is set to true.}

\item{...}{additional arguments that may be passed to the underlying \code{\link[stats:glm]{glm}} model.}
}
\value{
\code{stdm} returns an object of \code{\link[base::class]{class} "stdm"}.

The function \code{summary} can be used to obtain and print a summary of the underlying glm outcome model.

An object of class \code{"stdm"} is a list containing the following:

\tabular{ll}{
 \code{call} \tab the matched call. \cr
 \tab \cr
 \code{formula} \tab the formula used in the model. \cr
 \tab \cr
 \code{model} \tab the underlying glm model. \cr
 \tab \cr
 \code{weights} \tab the estimated IP weights. \cr
 \tab \cr
 \code{ATE} \tab the estimated average treatment effect. \cr
 \tab \cr
 \code{ATE.summary} \tab a data frame containing the ATE, SE, and 95\% CI of the ATE. \cr
}
}
\description{
`stdm` uses the \code{\link[propensity_scores]{propensity_scores}} function to generate inverse probability
weights. The weights can either be standardized weights or non-standardized weights. The weights are used to train a
general linear model whose coefficient for treatment represents the average treatment effect on the additive scale.
